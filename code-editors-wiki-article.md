# Code Editors

Source code editors are the programs that allow for code creation and 
editing. Any text editor can be used to write code. But dedicated code
editors offer many useful features, including: text completion, 
markup coloring, and tabs/panes for side-by-side editing. These features can 
be useful even to new users who don't know their way around all of the 
advanced options. 

There are many, many editors availble to download or use
online, both paid and free. They offer many of the same core-features, but
each have their own subtlties. Further research may help find the one that's
right for you. The following editors are all cross-platform and 
free to use or evaluate.

Sublime Text is a very popular editor that has been around since 2008. There 
are many options and extensions available, and a lot of help available online 
to help set it up. (Sublime Text is $70, but generously allows you unlimited 
use for "evaluation" with a nag-screen pop-up.)

Brackets is a relatively new open-source editor by Adobe. It is very user
friendly, especially for people who aren't used to command-line interfaces
or JSON-style settings/prefereces. Extensions and themes are quick and easy 
to find and install through the Extension Manager.

## [Atom](https://atom.io/) <img src="https://www.pubnub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/B62xj9FCUAA3YoC.png" alt="Atom Icon" height=32px />

Atom is used as much or more as Sublime Text. It is very configurable 
("hackable", as they say) but advanced features may be overwhelming to new 
users. There is plenty of helpful documentation availble online.
